## *Abstract*

### *Objectives at the beginning of the project*

The idea was to photograph an area with vegetation with the infrared camera. Then get the NDVI (Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index), of that area. Generated these photographs would be compared with other earlier infrared images. Such
comparison would have allowed to understand the variation of biomass in the years or however the variation in a
determined span of time. The proposal provided for the use of machine learning, in order to train the software to the
recognition of clouds and sea, so as to discard photographs that would occupy valuable space to be allocated, instead,
to photographs with the presence of biomass. Unfortunately, the main objective has become difficult to pursue because
the photos provided to us will not be comparable to those that will be obtained. They have no vegetation and have been
taken with a different sensor and with the blue filter, not suitable for the needs of the experiment. For the same
reason, moreover, machine learning had to be abandoned, as the photographs provided were few and not suitable. Given the
conditions, we contacted the support group that provided us in January recent photographs taken in the hardware
conditions in our kit, suggesting to adapt the project objectives to the new conditions. The project has thus changed
its objectives.

### *Final objectives of the project*

The images taken previously were not even suitable for a comparison to compare the amount of vegetation. The final
objective of the project has varied towards two paths:

- *The first possible use of the data obtained would be to create a database of data and images that could benefit
  subsequent projects.*
- *The second possible use of the obtained data would be to compare them with data and images that will be provided by
  the University of Naples Federico II.*
